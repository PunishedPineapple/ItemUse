Bugs:

To Do:
	- Icon for leves
	- Automatically determine GC.
	- Can we easily highlight the "Crafting Material" and aquarium text in the tooltip?
		-This is pulled from the Addon sheet (entry 996 for crafting materials).
		-Can we hook where it's grabbed and add in color payloads there rather than editing the ATKArrayData?
	- Allow hightlighting item name text in a specified color for a given category?
	- Handle coffer manifests (show job(s) for which a coffer will produce a GC/leve item).
		- Since it's manually-compiled data, do automatic updates like distances, or just package with the plugin and re-release each time?
	- Handle PLD arms items.
		- Do this as part of coffer manifests, or separately to just have the regular flags and make it cleaner?
			-Or have a separate flag?
		- These are in the game files with the "AdditionalData" column of the item sheet possibly providing an index into the ArchiveItem sheet.
			-May be more to it than that, but this is where to pick back up on it later.
