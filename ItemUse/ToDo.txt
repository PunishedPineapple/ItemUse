Bugs:

To Do:
	- Icon for leves
	- Icon for GC
	- Can we easily highlight the "Crafting Material" and aquarium text in the tooltip?
	- Allow hightlighting item name text in a specified color for a given category.
	- Handle coffer manifests (show job(s) for which a coffer will produce a GC/leve item).
		- Since it's manually-compiled data, do automatic updates like distances, or just package with the plugin and re-release each time?

Notes:
