Bugs:


To Do:
	- Better Icon for leves.
		- This may not be feasible with how complicated it would make things to not have coffer information as a simple SeString.
	- Flag items above a certain vendor sale gil threshold?
		- Most items like this have the "Exchangeable for gil." tag, although ones with other uses (i.e., fieldcraft and battlecraft demimateria) do not.
	- Add Ehcatl icon to plugin icon.
		- Or maybe gil icon if we do add the gil flag.
	- Is there a better addon lifecycle point to hook than update?  Update has been getting called more often than expected.
		- Not like the one text node that we are updating costs more than a couple microseconds, but it would be nice to make sure that we're doing it "right".
	- Move text string allocations into the UI memory space the next time that things go into testing.  It just seems like it would be neater to do it that way.
		- Verify that nothing that we allocate gets freed when the UI refreshes (i.e., using the aesthetician).
	- Draw the debug coffer manifest data as a table to make it a bit easier to read.


Rejected:
	- Allow hightlighting item name text in a specified color for a given category?
		- This doesn't feel that useful anymore with all the other options we have now.
