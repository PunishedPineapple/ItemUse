Bugs:


To Do:
	- Better Icon for leves.
		- This may not be feasible with how complicated it would make things be by not having the information as an SeString for coffers.
	- Allow hightlighting item name text in a specified color for a given category?
	- Flag items above a certain vendor sale gil threshold?
	- Add Ehcatl icon to plugin icon.
		- Or maybe gil icon if we do add the gil flag.
	- Is there a better addon lifecycle point to hook than update?  Update has been getting called more often than expected.
	- Move text string allocations into the UI memory space.  It just seems like it would be neater to do it that way.
	- Draw the coffer manifest data in a table to make it a bit less difficult to read.
	- Dropdowns to let the user set the highlight colors.  Probably allow them to be set separately for each tag type.
