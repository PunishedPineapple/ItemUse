  "LoadPriority": -1, //  We want to load late to help avoid visual ordering issues with other plugins that hook ItemDetail generation (like Allagan Tools).  This is not a great solution (ordering will be messed up when plugins update), but not sure what else to do until/unless hook priorities get implemented or Dalamud ever mediates this like DTR.
